Hidden Gems is an app to get people in tech outdoor. The user can log in or register for an account. The user can share your location or put a place in the app. The user can then select murals, restaurants, and favorite locations from the drop-down menu. Let's say the user pick murals. The user will be taken to the attraction page, where the user can select a mural to go to. If the user chooses a mural, they will be re-directed to the page with the mural's name and address. They will have an option to go back or get directions. If they choose to push the direction button, google maps will come up, and they can decide how to get there. If they choose to go back, they will be re-directed back to the attraction page. They can choose another mural in that area or pick a new location and attraction. Once at the attraction of their choosing, the user can take a picture of the mural and upload it to their profile. They will also be able to link the images to social media.
The app's purpose is to help people get out and enjoy the outdoors while still being spread out and keep covid numbers down.
